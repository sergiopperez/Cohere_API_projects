# Cohere_API_projects
Experimenting with Cohere's platform to build NLP applications. This repo takes some of the notebooks in https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/tree/main/notebooks and plays with them. Note that to run them you need to get an API key from os.cohere.ai â€” you only need to create an account and that's all.
